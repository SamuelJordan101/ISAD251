# ISAD251
My repository for demonstrating ISAD251 database application development

This is the repository for demonstrating my pub application. This application is designed to let users order food and drinks and let admins change all of the details in the application. All of the requirements are able to be completed and all work as they should.

When first opening the application, you will be presented with a login screen. Here, you must login, with either a 1, as a user, or 2, as an admin. From here you are able to complete the user stories fully.

For creating an order and adding items as a user, you must first create the order, after which you are able to add items to it on the user add to order page.

## Requirements
1. As a customer I wish to order a drink/snack.
2. As a customer I wish to see what I have ordered.
3. As a customer I wish to add to my current order for a drink/snack.
4. As a customer I wish to cancel my order for a drink/snack.
5. As the admin I wish to enter details of the drinks/snacks I have for sale.
6. As the admin I wish to read the details of the drinks/snacks I have for sale.
7. As the admin I wish to view a customerâ€™s order(s).
8. As the admin I wish to edit the details of the drinks/snacks I have for sale.
9. As the admin I wish to withdraw a drink/snack from sale.
